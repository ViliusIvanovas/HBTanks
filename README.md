# HBTanks
The idea is to remake AZTanks, while learning to use Unity2D, the HB refers to Hansenberg, where both of us are students

## Power-Ups
| Name              | Action   |
| :---------------- | :------: |
| Seeking Missile   | Flies freely for a bit, then starts seeking closest player, does not explode off walls, can switch who it seeks |
| Multi Shot        | Let's you charge up for a little while, then relase many smaller bullets, slightly random in what angle they hit, maybe a like 5 Degree randomness, desparn faster |
| Laser             | Shoots almost instantly, has a small predicted path, shoots for quite a long distance |
| Ninja Star        | Bigger bullet, same speed, it explodes into a bunch of pieces that fly in 360 degrees through walls, this happens either when it hits a player, or it's time runs out |

## General Requirements
- Support for multiple players
- Randomly generate levels, in which all players can always reach any of the other players
- Power-Ups may only spawn inside the area able to be reached by players
- Be able to be played on the web on [Itch.io](https://viliusi.itch.io/hbtanks)
